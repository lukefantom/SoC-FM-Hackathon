- Any other information users and developers might need to know

The Spotify component is the main component and keeps all the state.

There is a playlist state which contains the playlist information pulled from the Spotify API. There is a URL state which is the URL sliced form the Spotify Playlist URI.

There is a genre state, this is used when performing the fetch to the API. It searches for playlists of a specified genre.

Lastly there is a station state, that contains the string of the current radio station playing

- Authorisation

The authorisation requires users to create an app in the Spotify developer, create a client ID and secret for their own app
